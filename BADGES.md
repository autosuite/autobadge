# Badge Meaning

If you're here, you've seen a repository using `autobadger` and want to know what some of these badges mean. Well, non-exhaustively, here's just that:

## Stability

Repository stability is how likely the repository/project is ready for use. There are three options here:

- `unstable`: the project is not at all ready for use, and potentially has no work done on it.
- `prerelease`: the project has finished Minimum Viable Product (MVP) but is potentailly buggy and can change (including with breaking backwards-incompatible changes) at any time.
- `stable`: the project has published its first stable, production-ready release and is now using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) completely.

Note that repository stability does not mean every artifact produced by this repository is stable. Changes are introduced all of the time. It just sets the expectations of stability for the officially released versions that come from the tags on the `master` branch.
