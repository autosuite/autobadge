## Introduction

GitHub Action that automatically manages a few types of badges in a predetermined area in your README.md file. Currently, this is two badges:

- Current version.
- Stability (post-1.0.0 release, pre-1.0.0 release, pre-0.1.0 release).

## Usage

This is best added to a workflow on `push` to any branch. Since it only detects the `README.md` file, there is no need to provide any additional information.

Note that you will need to have an action that performs a pre-commit (stage, commit) and push:

```yaml
name: my-workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  autocommit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: autosuite/autosuite@master
        with:
          commit-filter: skip-log, skip-ci, automated
      - uses: autosuite/autobadger@master
      - uses: autosuite/autoversion@master
        with:
          managers: npm
      - uses: autosuite/autologger@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github_repository: ${{ github.repository }}
      - uses: autosuite/automilestone@master
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github-repository: ${{ github.repository }}
      - uses: autosuite/autocommit@master
      - uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Next, add the following lines to anywhere in your `README.md` file:

```md
[release-stability]: foo
[latest-release]: foo
```

As well as these lines:

```md
| Summary           | Badge                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Release Stability | ![Autobadger Release Stability][release-stability] |
| Latest Release    | ![Autobadger Latest Release][latest-release]       |
```
